# Ownership

 - Deals with how a memory reference is managed in a program.
 - Any program when executing, stores data in two different regions of computer volatile memory with different guarantees:
	 - **Stack**: Stores local variables, that have scope limited to a function execution or block, and whose size is known during compile time.
	 - **Heap**: Stores global variables or values that need to be in existence till the end of program, or whose size is dynamic.
	 - **Static**: Stores binary instructions of program and static variables.
 - In any program, written in Rust or any other language, a variable that stores data with a **known** and **fixed** size is stored in stack. For example `let x: i32 = 5;` will take 32 bits of memory in our program. Here, both the variable and the value, will be stored in stack.

> [!NOTE] Stack vs Heap
> - Stack supports fast memory creation and retrieval.
> - Memory occupied by unused code is automatically recaptured by the program after it goes out of the scope.
> - Heaps on the other hand, provide flexibility in terms of memory allocations. Values that can grow in size, like vectors, hash maps, strings, etc, live on heap.
> - heaps also allow for memory(and thus values) to live beyond the scope that created it.
> - Memory used by values in heap are recaptured when the last owner goes out of scope. 

 - Lets consider below code:
```rust
let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
vec1.push(4);
println!("{:?}", vec1);
drop(vec1);
```
- Vector is declared a *mutable*. So it can change or its size can change when the program is running. So, the vector object is stored in stack and the actual content(value) of the vector is stored in heap.
- When we drop the variable, both *the* data on stack and heap(the value and the object/var) will not be accessible.
 - For programs that use pointers, this could be problematic since, two or more variables can "point" to same memory location.
 - Lets say in a C/C++ program, a memory location is referenced by 2 variables. Now accidentally, you delete/free one of the variables which also frees the memory location.
   The other pointer will become a "dandling pointer", which can cause program to crash if trying to de-reference the pointer.
- Rust solves this problem by ownership rules. These set of rules are verified by compiler at compile time. 

- Lets consider another example:
```rust
let mut say = String::from("Indi");
say.push_str("a");

say_what = say;

println!(say); // will cause compiler error
```

> [!info] Rules of Ownership:
> 1. Each value in Rust is associated with / assigned to a variable. This variable is called the **owner** of the value. In above example code, `say` is the owner of the string.
> 2. There can be **only one owner** of a value at *heap*, at a time. In above example, when we assign *value* of `say` to `say_what` in line 3, the ownership of string *moves* to `say_what`, and **invalidates** the ownership of `say`.  Line 4 therefore, result in error, since variable `say` doesn't has ownership of the value.
> 3. When the owner goes **out of scope**, the value will be **dropped**. 

- The ownership prevents below safety issues:
	1. Dangling pointers
	2. Double-free: Trying to free memory that has already been freed
	3. Memory leaks: Not freeing memory that should have been freed
# Borrowing
## Scopes
- Scope is the **range** within a program, for which that **variable** and the **value** are **valid/accessible**.
- scopes define the region of code within which variables, types, functions, and other constructs are valid.
- Lets consider below example:

```rust
fn print_out(to_print: String) {
	println!("{}", to_print);
}

fn main() {
	let say = String::from("Cat");
	print_out(say);

	println!("Again {}", say);
}
```

- When we pass, a value to function(in the above code `say` to `print_out`), we transfer ownership to that function.
- Once we transfer ownership, the value is out of scope, in the caller.
- If we try to access the value of the transferred/moved, we get error, since the value is no longer **valid**.

- But we do need to pass values around functions. To do that, we need to tell the compiler, how exactly the value will be used.
- In other languages, we can pass data around functions using 2 methods: pass by value and pass by reference.
- In Rust, if just need to send a copy, we explicitly clone the value and send it. This will create a copy of the value in stack or heap(depending on mutability). Example:
```rust
fn print_out(to_print: String) {
	println!("{}", to_print);
}

fn main() {
	let say = String::from("Cat");
	print_out(say.clone());

	println!("Again {}", say);
}
```
- Cloning is expensive though, since you create new copy every time.

- If we want to send the same underlying value, we pass a reference of the value. Example:
```rust
fn print_out(to_print: &String) {
	println!("{}", to_print);
}

fn main() {
	let say = String::from("Cat");
	print_out(&say);

	println!("Again {}", say);
}
```

- When we pass by reference, we say the called function is **borrowing** the value.
**Borrowing** is:
- Establishing a reference to some data in memory
	- it is like pointers with added rules
	- it does **not** take ownership
> [!info]  Rules of Borrowing:
> 1. At any given time, You can have either:
> 	- one mutable reference, or
> 	- any number of immutable references.
> 2. References must always be valid.

These rules solve the problem of **data races** and **dandling references**.

- References by default are immutable, but can be made mutable using `mut` keyword.
- Example:
```rust
fn add_to_vec(a_vec: &mut Vec<i32>) {
	a_vec.push(4);
}

fn main() {
	let mut my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
	println!("{:?}", my_vec);

	add_to_vec(&mut my_vec);
	println!("{:?}", my_vec);
}

// Output:
// [ 1, 2, 3 ]
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```
#### Dangling References (Prevented by Rust)
Rust ensures that references are never dangling.
```rust
fn main() {
    let r;
    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x; // Error: x does not live long enough
    }
    println!("{}", r); // !!! r would point to invalid memory
}
```

The below code will not compile because, `some_vec` 's `&mut self` reference is passed in `push` while an immutable reference is still in scope and passed to `println` and `get_first_element`.
```rust
fn main() {
	let mut some_vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
	let first = get_first_element(&some_vec);
	some_vec.push(4);
	println!("The first number is: {}", first);
}

fn get_first_element(num_vec: &Vec<i32>) -> &i32 {
	&num_vec[0]
}
```

## Special Cases
### **Borrowing and Mutability**
Even if a value is mutable, an immutable reference can still be created as long as there are no active mutable references.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // Immutable reference
    println!("{}", r1); // r1 used here
    let r2 = &mut s; // Mutable reference allowed after r1 is done
    r2.push_str(", world");
    println!("{}", r2);
}
```
### **Reborrowing**
Rust allows **reborrowing** of references.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &*r1; // Reborrowing as immutable reference
    println!("{}", r2);
}
```
Mutable reference(`& mut`) cannot be copied, but can only be moved.
- References reside in stack.
- Stack allocated data, when assigned to a new variable, are copied and assigned to new variable. The ownership is not moved.
- However, mutable references, which themselves are stored on stack, is an exception.
- This is done to ensure conformity with Rust borrowing rule.
	- According to the rules of borrowing discussed above, we cannot have multiple mutable references.
example:
```rust
let mut heap_data = vec![5, 6, 7];
let ref_1 = &mut heap_data;

let move_ref_out = ref1; // mutable reference `move`d to move_ref_out. ref_1 will no longer be valid
let move_ref_again = ref_1; // error out, trying to create another mutable ref from ref_1 when it longer is valid.
```
> The above code would have worked if all of them were immutable references. Also, immutable references are copied and not moved, so ref_1 would still hold a reference.
# `&mut self` and `&self` 
In Rust, the usage of `&self`, `&mut self`, and their relationship with references revolves around **ownership**, **borrowing**, and **mutability** when implementing methods for structs or enums. Letâ€™s delve into their meanings and nuances.
## `&self` and `&mut self` in Method Definitions
### **1. `&self`: Immutable Borrow**
- When a method takes `&self`, it borrows the instance of the type immutably.
- This means the method can **read** but not **modify** the instance.
```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    // Method with an immutable borrow
    fn get_coordinates(&self) -> (i32, i32) {
        (self.x, self.y) // Can access fields but cannot modify them
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };
    let coords = p.get_coordinates(); // p is immutably borrowed
    println!("Coordinates: {:?}", coords); // p is still valid here
}
```
### **2. `&mut self`: Mutable Borrow**
- When a method takes `&mut self`, it borrows the instance **mutably**.
- This allows the method to both **read** and **modify** the instance.
```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    // Method with a mutable borrow
    fn move_by(&mut self, dx: i32, dy: i32) {
        self.x += dx;
        self.y += dy; // Modifying the instance
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 }; // p must be mutable
    p.move_by(2, 3); // p is mutably borrowed
    println!("Moved Point: ({}, {})", p.x, p.y);
}
```
### **Why Distinction Matters**
1. **Ownership and Borrowing Rules**:
    - A `&self` method allows multiple calls simultaneously because it doesn't modify the object.
    - A `&mut self` method requires exclusive access to the object while it is being called.
2. **Safety**:
    - Rust enforces that immutable and mutable borrows cannot coexist, preventing data races.
## **Reference Behavior in `&self` and `&mut self`**
### **1. Passing `self` by Reference**
Both `&self` and `&mut self` are syntactic sugar for explicit references to `self`:
- `fn method(&self)` is shorthand for `fn method(self: &Self)`.
- `fn method(&mut self)` is shorthand for `fn method(self: &mut Self)`.
This means `self` is a **reference** to the object, not the object itself.
```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    // Explicit reference
    fn get_coordinates(self: &Self) -> (i32, i32) {
        (self.x, self.y)
    }
    fn move_by(self: &mut Self, dx: i32, dy: i32) {
        self.x += dx;
        self.y += dy;
    }
}
```
### **2. Ownership of `self`**
You can also define methods that take ownership of `self` instead of borrowing it. These are useful when you want the method to consume the instance.
```rust
impl Point {
    fn into_tuple(self) -> (i32, i32) {
        (self.x, self.y) // Takes ownership of self
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };
    let tuple = p.into_tuple(); // p is consumed and no longer valid
    println!("Point as tuple: {:?}", tuple);
}
```
## **Reference Mutability Rules with `&self` and `&mut self`**
### **Immutable References (`&self`)**
Multiple immutable references can coexist safely because no modifications are allowed.
```rust
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };

    let r1 = &p;
    let r2 = &p;

    println!("r1: ({}, {}), r2: ({}, {})", r1.x, r1.y, r2.x, r2.y);
    // Both r1 and r2 can access `p` at the same time.
}
```
### **Mutable References (`&mut self`)**
Only one mutable reference is allowed at a time.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };

    let r1 = &mut p;
    // let r2 = &mut p; // Error: cannot borrow `p` as mutable more than once
    r1.x += 1;
    println!("Updated r1: ({}, {})", r1.x, r1.y);
}
```
### **Immutable and Mutable References Cannot Coexist**
Rust prevents simultaneous mutable and immutable references to ensure safety.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };

    let r1 = &p;          // Immutable borrow
    // let r2 = &mut p;   // Error: cannot borrow `p` as mutable because it is already borrowed immutably
    println!("Immutable r1: ({}, {})", r1.x, r1.y);
}
```
## **Use Cases for `&self`, `&mut self`, and `self`**
1. **Use `&self`**:
    - When the method does not modify the instance.
    - Example: `fn len(&self) -> usize`.
2. **Use `&mut self`**:
    - When the method modifies the instance.
    - Example: `fn push(&mut self, value: T)`.
3. **Use `self`**:
    - When the method consumes the instance (e.g., transforms it or moves its contents elsewhere).
    - Example: `fn into_vec(self) -> Vec<T>`.
## **Advanced Nuances**
### **1. Chaining Mutable Methods**
Mutable methods can be chained if they return `&mut self`:
```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn move_x(&mut self, dx: i32) -> &mut Self {
        self.x += dx;
        self
    }
    fn move_y(&mut self, dy: i32) -> &mut Self {
        self.y += dy;
        self
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut p = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

    p.move_x(5).move_y(3); // Method chaining
    println!("Point: ({}, {})", p.x, p.y);
}
```
### **2. Using `self` with Closures**
Passing `self` into closures requires understanding borrowing vs. ownership:
```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };

    let closure = move || {
        println!("Point: ({}, {})", p.x, p.y);
    }; // `p` is moved into the closure
    closure();
}
```
# Dereferencing
Dereferencing in Rust involves accessing the data that a reference or pointer points to. Rust has strict and well-defined rules for dereferencing, ensuring safety while allowing you to work with references and smart pointers.
In Rust, this is done using the **dereference operator** (`*`).
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x; // y is a reference to x

    println!("y: {}", *y); // Dereferencing y to access the value of x
}
// y: 5
```
## **Types of References and Pointers in Rust**
1. **References** (`&T` and `&mut T`): Borrowed references.
2. **Raw Pointers** (`*const T` and `*mut T`): Unsafe, low-level pointers.
3. **Smart Pointers**: Abstractions over raw pointers, like `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, or `Arc<T>`.




## The 'ref' keyword
Sometimes you may be want to use some portion of a tuple or a struct as a reference while other parts as owned values. For instance, consider the code below
```rust
fn main() {
 Â  Â  let tuple = (String::from("Hello"), 42);
 Â  Â  let (s, num) = tuple;
}
```

We would like 's' to use a reference to string, while `num` as owned value. If we use the

```rust
 let (s, num) = &tuple;
```
it will make both `s` and `num` as references. To achieve the desired behaviour, we can use the ref keyword. The updated statement will look like
```rust
let (ref s, num) = tuple;
```
This will make the type of s as a &String while `num` will remain as owned value with a type of i32. Although specific use cases of this is rare, this is just good to know.

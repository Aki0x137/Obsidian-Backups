## Why do we need to understand this?
- We can still write parallel code without work scheduler's knowledge.
- However, knowing the basics of work stealing will make you a better programmer.
- We want to know, if we can divide a task in small chunk, what strategies can we use so that our multi core CPU can be used as efficiently as possible?

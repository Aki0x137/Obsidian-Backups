# SAT Solvers: An Introduction and Go Implementation

## 1. Introduction
Inspired by [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vipulvaibhaw_github-vaibhawvipulconcurrent-sat-solver-rs-activity-7152645737560866818-i6TK) by Vipul Vaibhaw, this article aims to demystify SAT solvers and provide a step-by-step guide to implementing one in Go. SAT solvers are fascinating tools used in various fields, from computer science research to practical applications like hardware verification and software testing. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a curious newcomer, this guide will help you understand what SAT solvers are, why they matter, and how you can build one yourself.

## 2. What is SAT?

SAT, short for "satisfiability," refers to the problem of determining whether there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. In simpler terms, it's about figuring out if there's a way to assign truth values to variables such that the entire formula evaluates to true. 

### 2.1 Why should I know about it?
Understanding SAT is crucial because it is a fundamental problem in computer science. Many complex problems in areas like artificial intelligence, operations research, and electronic design automation can be reduced to SAT problems. By solving SAT, we can solve a wide range of practical issues, from optimizing supply chains to verifying the correctness of software.

## 3. A bit of math...

Let's break down the SAT problem with a bit of math. A Boolean formula is typically expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals. 

For example, consider the formula:
```
(F) = (A ∨ ¬B ∨ C) ∧ (¬A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ B)
```
Here, \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are Boolean variables, and \(¬\) denotes negation. The formula \(F\) is satisfied if there's a way to assign true or false to \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that all the clauses are true.

To solve SAT, we need to check if there's an assignment of truth values to variables that makes the entire formula true. If such an assignment exists, the formula is "satisfiable"; otherwise, it's "unsatisfiable."

## 4. Writing a concurrent SAT Solver in Go

Now, let's dive into the practical part: writing a concurrent SAT solver in Go. Go, with its built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels, is an excellent choice for building efficient and scalable SAT solvers.

### Step 1: Set up your Go environment
First, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Go module:
```sh
mkdir sat-solver
cd sat-solver
go mod init sat-solver
```

### Step 2: Define the data structures
We need data structures to represent our Boolean formula, clauses, and literals. Create a file named `solver.go` and start by defining these structures:
```go
package main

type Literal struct {
    Variable int
    Negated  bool
}

type Clause struct {
    Literals []Literal
}

type Formula struct {
    Clauses []Clause
}
```

### Step 3: Parse the input
Next, we'll write a function to parse a CNF formula from a string input. This function will convert the input into our `Formula` structure:
```go
func parseFormula(input string) Formula {
    // Implementation of parsing logic goes here
    // This will convert input string to Formula struct
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the DPLL algorithm
The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm is a popular method for solving SAT problems. We'll implement this algorithm using recursion and backtracking:
```go
func solve(formula Formula) bool {
    // Base case: if the formula is empty, it's satisfiable
    if len(formula.Clauses) == 0 {
        return true
    }

    // Base case: if any clause is empty, it's unsatisfiable
    for _, clause := range formula.Clauses {
        if len(clause.Literals) == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }

    // Choose a literal to assign and recursively solve
    // Implementation of the DPLL algorithm goes here

    return false // Placeholder return
}
```

### Step 5: Add concurrency
To make our solver concurrent, we'll use Go's goroutines and channels. We'll create worker goroutines to process different parts of the formula in parallel:
```go
func concurrentSolve(formula Formula) bool {
    results := make(chan bool)
    defer close(results)

    // Launch worker goroutines
    for i := 0; i < runtime.NumCPU(); i++ {
        go func() {
            results <- solve(formula)
        }()
    }

    // Collect results from workers
    for i := 0; i < runtime.NumCPU(); i++ {
        if <-results {
            return true
        }
    }

    return false
}
```

### Step 6: Putting it all together
Finally, we'll write a `main` function to tie everything together and run our solver:
```go
func main() {
    input := "your CNF formula here"
    formula := parseFormula(input)

    if concurrentSolve(formula) {
        fmt.Println("Satisfiable")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Unsatisfiable")
    }
}
```

Congratulations! You've just built a basic concurrent SAT solver in Go. This is a starting point; there's plenty of room for optimization and enhancement. For instance, you can implement advanced heuristics for choosing literals, add support for different input formats, and explore further concurrency improvements.

SAT solvers are powerful tools with wide-ranging applications. By understanding and implementing one, you've taken a significant step into the fascinating world of computational problem-solving. Happy coding!

This is crucial in systems where tasks might have different priorities or where user-facing responsiveness is critical.

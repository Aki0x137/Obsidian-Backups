## 1. Introduction:

In the realm of computer science, solving problems efficiently and accurately is the name of the game. One fascinating problem-solving method that has gained traction is the use of SAT solvers. This article dives into the world of SAT solvers, inspired by a LinkedIn post by Vipul Vaibhaw, where he shared his experience with implementing a concurrent SAT solver in Rust. You can find his original post [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vipulvaibhaw_github-vaibhawvipulconcurrent-sat-solver-rs-activity-7152645737560866818-i6TK). Here, we'll break down the concept of SAT solvers and guide you through creating a concurrent SAT solver in Go, step by step.

## 2. What is SAT?

SAT, short for Satisfiability, is a cornerstone problem in computer science. It refers to the challenge of determining whether there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. In simpler terms, given a complex logical statement, can we assign values to its variables in such a way that the entire statement evaluates to true?

### 2.1. Why should I know about it?

Understanding SAT is more than an academic exercise; it has practical applications in various fields such as artificial intelligence, hardware design, and software testing. By mastering SAT, you can tackle a wide range of real-world problems that require logical decision-making and optimization. For example, SAT solvers are used in verifying software correctness, finding optimal configurations in systems, and even in planning and scheduling tasks.

## 3. A bit of math...

To grasp SAT solvers, let's dive into a bit of Boolean algebra. A Boolean formula is composed of variables, operators (AND, OR, NOT), and parentheses. For instance, a simple Boolean formula might look like this:

\[ (A \vee \neg B) \wedge (B \vee C) \]

In this formula:
- \( \vee \) represents the OR operator.
- \( \wedge \) represents the AND operator.
- \( \neg \) represents the NOT operator.

The task of a SAT solver is to determine if there is a way to assign true (T) or false (F) values to the variables (A, B, and C) such that the entire formula evaluates to true. If such an assignment exists, the formula is said to be satisfiable; otherwise, it is unsatisfiable.

## 4. Writing a concurrent SAT Solver in Go

Now that we have a basic understanding of SAT, let's explore how to write a concurrent SAT solver in Go. Go's concurrency model, based on goroutines and channels, makes it a suitable choice for implementing efficient and scalable solvers.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Go Environment

First, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/). Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Go module:

```bash
mkdir concurrent-sat-solver
cd concurrent-sat-solver
go mod init concurrent-sat-solver
```

### Step 2: Defining the Problem

We'll start by defining the data structures to represent Boolean formulas and variables. Create a file named `solver.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Variable represents a Boolean variable
type Variable struct {
	Name  string
	Value bool
}

// Clause represents a disjunction of variables
type Clause struct {
	Variables []Variable
}

// Formula represents a conjunction of clauses
type Formula struct {
	Clauses []Clause
}

// IsSatisfied checks if the formula is satisfied with the current variable assignments
func (f *Formula) IsSatisfied() bool {
	for _, clause := range f.Clauses {
		clauseSatisfied := false
		for _, variable := range clause.Variables {
			if variable.Value {
				clauseSatisfied = true
				break
			}
		}
		if !clauseSatisfied {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

### Step 3: Implementing the Solver

Next, we'll implement the core logic of the SAT solver. We'll use a simple backtracking algorithm to find a satisfying assignment. To leverage concurrency, we'll divide the work among multiple goroutines.

```go
// Solve attempts to find a satisfying assignment for the formula
func (f *Formula) Solve() bool {
	variableCount := len(f.Clauses[0].Variables)
	results := make(chan bool)
	done := make(chan bool)

	// Launch goroutines for each possible assignment
	for i := 0; i < (1 << variableCount); i++ {
		go func(assignment int) {
			for j := 0; j < variableCount; j++ {
				f.Clauses[0].Variables[j].Value = (assignment & (1 << j)) != 0
			}
			if f.IsSatisfied() {
				results <- true
				done <- true
			}
		}(i)
	}

	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < (1 << variableCount); i++ {
			if <-results {
				break
			}
		}
		close(done)
	}()

	select {
	case <-done:
		return true
	case <-results:
		return false
	}
}
```

### Step 4: Testing the Solver

Finally, let's test our SAT solver with a simple example. Add the following code to the `main` function in `solver.go`:

```go
func main() {
	// Example formula: (A OR NOT B) AND (B OR C)
	formula := Formula{
		Clauses: []Clause{
			{Variables: []Variable{{Name: "A"}, {Name: "B", Value: false}}},
			{Variables: []Variable{{Name: "B"}, {Name: "C"}}},
		},
	}

	if formula.Solve() {
		fmt.Println("The formula is satisfiable!")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("The formula is unsatisfiable.")
	}
}
```

Run your program with `go run solver.go`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the output indicating whether the formula is satisfiable.

## Conclusion

Building a SAT solver from scratch is a rewarding experience that deepens your understanding of algorithms, logic, and concurrency. While our implementation is simple and might not compete with industrial-strength solvers, it's a great starting point for further exploration. With Go's powerful concurrency model, you can scale and optimize your solver for more complex and larger problems. Happy coding!

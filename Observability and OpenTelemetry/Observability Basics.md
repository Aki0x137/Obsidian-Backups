# What is Observability?
Observability is a broad term that encompasses the ability to know about the state of the system(application, database, front-end, etc.), specifically about its performance and errors.

One thing to remember is that observability helps debug or monitor performance of system without directly interacting with the system (having to ssh into the machine, or placing debuggers, or asking customers to install a modified version of application). We just output some data to understand the flow and state.

The types of these outputs and what they tell us about the system is explored below.

## Key Components of Observability:
### 1. Logs

### 2. Metrics

### 3. Traces

## Purpose:

## Observability v/s Monitoring
**Monitoring**: It is the practice of collecting and analyzing predefined metric and logs to ensure a system is running as expected. It often relies on the setting of thresholds and alerts based on known patterns.
**Observability**: It focuses on understanding the unknowns by examining the outputs (logs, metrics, traces) of a system to infer its internal states. It enables deeper insights and faster problem resolution, especially in complex systems where unforeseen issue can arise.
